# ATM Simulator System ✨

## Overview
The **ATM Simulator System** is a Java-based project that replicates the functionalities of a real-world ATM. It enables users to perform essential banking operations such as opening a bank account, deposits, withdrawals, mini statements, and PIN changes. The project is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, ensuring secure and seamless financial transactions. 🏦💳

## Motivation 💡
With the growing need for digital banking solutions, we embarked on this project to simulate ATM functionalities while deepening our understanding of Java programming, database connectivity, and GUI development. Java is widely used for developing secure and scalable financial applications, making it an ideal choice for this project. Our goal was to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world applications by developing a fully functional ATM system.

## Features 🛠
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for account holders.
- **Open Banking Account**: Allows new users to create an account.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users can deposit and withdraw money seamlessly.
- **Mini Statement**: Provides transaction history.
- **PIN Change**: Users can update their PIN securely.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Java**: Core application development, leveraging object-oriented principles.
- **Swing & AWT**: GUI design for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **JDBC**: Database connectivity for handling transactions efficiently.
- **MySQL**: Backend database for secure storage of user details and transactions.

## Installation 📝
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in NetBeans or any Java IDE.
3. Configure the MySQL database and update connection details in `Conn.java`.
4. Run the project and start using the ATM functionalities.

## Future Enhancements 🔄
